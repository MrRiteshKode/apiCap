apiCap is a python gui api testing tool for (GET, POST ,PUT,PATCH ,DELETE) request.

It is made up of tkinter and customtkinter as well. I allows to do s single request at a time (GET, POST ,PUT,PATCH ,DELETE).

Usage:-
1. install requirements ( pip install -r requirements.txt )
2. then open any terminal.
3. And write :- python apiCap.py
4. Then it will open.

Thinks:
1. It might be slow for large data(receive).
2. if you switch from one frame to another(get to post) then data will be wiped out. So if you do a request then data will stay until you don't change frame.

Thanks you :)
